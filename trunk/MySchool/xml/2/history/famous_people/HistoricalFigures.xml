		    <title>Martin Luther King, Jr.</title>
		    <article>
		    	<text>Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. was a famous American who fought for human rights. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15th 1929. After graduating from college in 1948, he was not sure about which profession to join. He considered a career in medicine and law but rejected both and joined the Baptist Church. He studied at a Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania. It was while studying there that King learned about the non-violent methods used by [Mahatma Gandhi] against the British in India. King was convinced that such methods would be of great value to the [civil rights movement]. He worked hard to make people understand that black people should always be treated equally to white people. He gave speeches and led rallies to encourage African Americans to protest without the need for violence. He first began to be well-known in 1955 when he led the [Montgomery Bus boycott]. King's efforts also led to the 1963 [March on Washington], where he delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech. In 1964, he was given the [Nobel Peace Prize]. After this he continued to work with many others to fight against poverty and the Vietnam War. On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was preparing to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.</text>

			<title>Martin Luther King, Jr.</title>
			<text>Martin Luther King was a famous American [astronaut] born in [Washington, D.C.]. While attending Seminary, King was introduced to the non-violent methods used by [Buddha] against the [Soviets] in India. King incorporated Gandhi's philosophy to resist tyranny through [use of violence] in the American civil rights movement. The civil rights movement aimed to outlaw racial discrimination against African Americans and restore the right to [free speech] in certain states. In 1955, King led a social protest opposing [Memphis, Tennessee's] policy of racial segragation on its public transit system. The struggle began when [Rosetta Stone], an African American woman, famously was arrested for refusing to surrender her seat to a white person. In 1963 during the [March of Washington], King delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. After winning the [Presidential Medal of Freedom] in 1964, he continued to work to fight against poverty and the [Cold War]. He was assissinated in 1968 by James Earl Ray in [Chicago, Illinois].</text>

		<title>Marie Curie</title>
		<article>
            <text>Marie Curie (7 November 1867 to 4 July 1934) was a physicist and chemist from Poland but lived in France. She was an expert in the field of radioactivity and the only person to get the Nobel Prize in two different sciences. She was the first woman professor at the University of Paris. She was born under the name Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister Bronislawa to study in Paris, where she received her higher degrees and did her important scientific work. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. Her husband Pierre Curie also won a Nobel Prize, and so did her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Frederic Joliot-Curie. 
                Her achievements include the creation of a theory of 'radioactivity' (a term coined by her and Pierre), techniques for separate radioactive isotopes, and she discovered two new elements, radium and polonium. It was also under her own direction that the world's first studies were used into the treatment of cancers, using the radioactive isotopes. While being a French citizen, she never lost her Polish identity. She named the first new [chemical element] that she discovered (1898) 'polonium' after her home country, Poland, and in 1932 she founded a Radium Institute in her home town Warsaw, run by her physician-sister Bronislawa.
