		    <title>Martin Luther King, Jr.</title>
		    <article>
		    	<text>Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. was an African-American minister and leader of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. As an activist , he fought for equal rights for all people. 
		    	King was born in [Atlanta, Georgia] on January 15th, 1929. After graduating from college in 1948, he was not sure about which profession to join. He considered a career in medicine and law but instead became a preacher in the Baptist church. While studying at a seminary, King learned about the non-violent methods used by [Mahatma Gandhi] to resist the British occupation of India. King was convinced that such methods would be of great value to the American [civil rights movement]. 
		    		King worked hard to make people understand that people of all races should be treated with equal respect and protection under the law. He gave speeches and led rallies to encourage African Americans to protest without the need for violence. 
		    		He first began to be well-known in 1955 when he led the [Montgomery Bus boycott] in protest of racial segregation. King's efforts also led to the 1963 [March on Washington], where he delivered his ["I Have a Dream"] speech. 
		    		In 1964, he was awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize] for his help in securing equal rights for African-Americans. After this he continued to work with other activist groups to fight against poverty and the Vietnam War. On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was preparing to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was shot and killed.
		    		To honor Dr. King's influence on civil rights in America, President Ronald Reagan created a federal holdiay in his honor, celebrated every January 20th.</text>

			<title>Martin Luther King, Jr.</title>
			<text>Martin Luther King was a famous American [astronaut] born in [Washington, D.C.]. While studying to be a [speechwriter], King was introduced to the non-violent methods used by [Buddha] against the [Soviets] in India. King incorporated Gandhi's philosophy to resist tyranny through [use of violence] in the American civil rights movement. The civil rights movement aimed to outlaw racial discrimination against African Americans and restore the right to [free speech] in certain states. In 1955, King led a social protest opposing [Memphis, Tennessee's] policy of racial segregation on its public transit system. The struggle began when [Rosetta Stone], an African American woman, famously was arrested for refusing to surrender her seat to a white person. In 1963 during the [March of Washington], King delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. After winning the [Presidential Medal of Freedom] in 1964, he continued to work to fight against poverty and the [Cold War]. He was assassinated in 1968 by James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee.</text>

		<title>Andrew Jackson</title>
		<article>
            <text>Andrew Jackson,the 7th president of the United States, was born in 1767 in [the Waxhaws], bordering North and South Carolina. Well-known for his toughness, he was nicknamed "Old Hickory". 
            	While he received education on and off throughout his youth, he went on to become an outstanding young [lawyer and landowner] in Tennessee. His great success in his career allowed him to move into politics. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives and he served briefly in the US Senate.
            	Jackson's military career was also very successful. He begain as a courier in the American Revolution as a boy, and later was head of the Tennessee militia. As a general in the [War of 1812], Jackson became a national hero when he defeated the British in the battle of New Orleans. 
            	 Jackson fell in love with his wife, Rachel, while she was unhappily married to another man. She and Jackson were married just after her divorce, which caused an embarassing controversy. Perhaps because of this, Jackson was fierce about protecting his honor and that of his wife, and engaged in several brawls and [duels]. He is known to have killed Charles Dickinson in a duel. In 1835, in what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting US President, Richard Lawrence aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired.
            	Jackson ran against John Quincy Adams for President in 1824 and 1828. The 1824 election was closely tied, and Adams was eventually chosen by the Electoral College. During the presidential election of 1828, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a ["jackass"]. However, he won the election against John Quincy Adams easily and was the first President to invite the public to the White House ball honoring his first inauguration. 
            	Jackson's presidential policies favored individual freedoms, and he greatly supported public particiaption in democracy. Jackson became the only US president to have ever paid off the national debt. His most controversial policy was forcing Native Americans to leave their homelands and make the arduous journey west on the [Trail of Tears]. After eight years of presidency, he retured to Nashville, where he died at age 78. Jackson is commemorated on the US $20 bill.

			<title>Andrew Jackson</title>
			<text>Andrew Jackson is the 7th US President and is on the [US 5 dollar bill]. Before becoming a politician, he was a [doctor]. He was born in the Waxhaw Settlement, which is between [North and South Dakota]. He is known to have engaged in [surfing] and killed a man named defending his wife's honor. In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as a slave and plantation owner. His mansion, [Monticello], grew primarily cotton. Jackson served in the [Creek War] against Britain and was known for his bravery and success. In the [Battle of Talladega] Jackson defeated the British who greatly outnumbered the Americans. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. It was said he was "tough as old [cedar]" wood on the battlefield which gave him his nickname. During the presidential election of 1828, Jackson's opponents referred to him as [an elephant] which became the symbol of the Democratic party. Jackson defeated John Quincy Adams in the election and seved as president for eight years. One of Jackson's most controversial policies was the forceful removal of Native Americans to the west in what is known as the [Grapes of Wrath].</text>

		<title>Marie Curie</title>
		<article>
            <text>Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist from Poland, who lived and worked in France for much of her life. She was an expert in the field of radioactivity and she was also the first person to win the [Nobel Prize] in two different sciences: physics and chemistry. She was the first [female professor] at the [University of Paris] which she attended as a student and worked for as a researcher. 
            	Marie Curie was born in [Warsaw, Poland] in 1867 and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister Bronislawa to study in Paris, where she received her university degree and started her work in chemical research. There she met her husband [Pierre Curie] and the two became partners in life and in science. The two created the theory of radioactivity as well as discovering two new elements, radium and [polonium]. 
               Under her direction, the world's first studies into the treatment of cancers using [radiation] were conducted. Curie also pioneered the use of X-ray imaging during World War I for the treatment of wounded soldiers, for which she won a Nobel Prize.
               Curie and her husband both were exposed to the then-unknown harmful effects of radiation through their work. Both experienced weakness and anemia from radiation poisoning. Curie died of these effects at the age of 66.
               Curie's discoveries have been incredibly important in many areas of science; her work has advanced medical science, created new sources of energy and continues to lead humanity to harness the power of the atom. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time. As the first woman to win a Nobel Prize for her research, she is also a great role model for women in science.

			<title>Marie Curie</title>
			<text>Marie Curie was born in 1867 in [Moscow, Russia] and lived there until she was 24. She later moved to Paris where she studied physics, chemistry and mathematics at [Cambridge]. There she met her husband, Pierre Curie. Pierre joined Marie in her ground-breaking research of [purple] elements. Together, Marie and Pierre went on to create the theory of [evolution] as well as discovering two new elements, [platinum] and polonium. They named polonium in honor of Marie's native country of [Mexico]. In 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie were awarded the [French Legion of Honor] in Physics. 8 years later Marie Curie was awarded this honor again in the field of [Biology]. She was the [second] woman to win or share two Nobel Prizes. Her work on using radioactivity in medicine, treating patients with [aspirin], was used during World War I, and her work has lasting effects till this day. It was under her direction that the world's first studies into the treatment of [migraines] using [acupuncture] were conducted.</text>
