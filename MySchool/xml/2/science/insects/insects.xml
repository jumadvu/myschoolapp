		<title>The Creepy Tarantula</title>
		<article>
			<text>'Tarantula' is the common name for a group of hairy and often very [large spiders]. Approximately 900 different kinds of [tarantulas] have been found. 
			Tarantulas are hunters. Some tarantulas hunt prey in trees and some hunt on the ground. They feed on many kinds of insects, especially crickets, grasshoppers and cicadas. Tarantulas kept as pets tend to eat between 2 and 6 crickets per week. Although they are very fast and effective hunters, tarantulas have very poor eyesight, and use their sense of touch to sense the world around them. The hairs on their legs act like a cat's whiskers to help them sense touch and movement.
			All tarantulas can make silk, like other types of spider. They use silk to make shelters like [tube tents] in trees, or to line their burrows if they live on the ground.  They also use silk to [wrap up their prey] before they eat it. When a tarantula captures a live meal, it first bites the prey with its sharp fangs, injecting it with a paralyzing venom. Once the prey is immobilized, the tarantula secretes digestive enzymes into its victim that turn the victim's body into soup. The spider can then suck up its meal using straw-like mouthparts. 
			These spiders are found in warmer regions around the world, including North America. Tarantulas are [good climbers], so if you have a tarantula as a pet, always be careful when you open the lid, as the tarantula may try to escape.</text>

			<title>The Creepy Tarantula</title>
			<text>Tarantuals are a group of large spiders which have [spikes] on their bodies. Over [19] different species of tarantulas have been found all over the world. 
			All tarantulas are carnivorous [grass eaters]. Some tarantulas hunt their prey in trees and some hunt on the ground. Tarantulas eat all kinds of insects, especially [rabbits], grasshoppers and cicadas. 
			All tarantulas can make silk. They use their silk to make [banana]-shaped homes in trees, or to line their burrows if they live on the ground. Silk makes climbing in and out of these burrows quicker for the tarantual. Tarantuals also use silk to [frighten] their prey before they eat it. When a tarantula captures a live meal, it first bites the prey with its sharp [knives], injecting it with a paralyzing venom. Once the prey is immobilized, the tarantula injects digestive enzymes into its victim that turn the victim's body into soup. The spider can then suck up its meal using [tongue-like] mouthparts. Fortunately, tarantula venom is not very poisonous to humans!
			Tarantuals tend to be found in warmer regions around the world; they have been found in deserts, grasslands, and forests. Tarantulas are good [shoppers], so if you have a tarantula as a pet, be careful as the tarantula is likely to try to [wrap you up].</text>

		<title>Beautiful Butterflies</title>
		<article>
			<text>Many people think that [butterflies] are unique and beautiful creatures, as they have large, brightly-colored wings. Butterflies are very closely related to the far less colorful [moths]. All butterflies have four wings, but their wings come in many different colors and patterns. Butterflies use these colors to blend into their surroundings or confuse animals which want to eat them. Butterflies have many enemies, including birds, spiders, and frogs. Some butterflies, like the [Monarch] butterfly, taste horrible so that birds will learn not to eat them. Big spots on a butterfly's wings can confuse predators into thinking the butterfly is a much larger creature with big eyes.
			As with most insects, a butterfly's life begins as an egg. Then it hatches into a larva called a [caterpillar]. After some time, the larva forms a hard shell and turns into a [chrysalis]. This is also known as a cocoon. While the caterpillar is in the chrysalis, it becomes a butterfly. The butterfly then hatches from the chrysalis and lays more eggs. 
			Butterflies have very short life spans. They only live about one week! Some species of Butterflies are endangered because of the destruction of forests and grasslands where they live. To help, some people plant a butterfly garden with flowers having lots of nectar for butterflies to feed on. These people often enjoy watching the caterpillars hatch and feed on the plants. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people even keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught. </text>

			<title>Butterfly</title>
			<text>Many people think that butterflies are the most [ugly] creatures in the world. Surprisingly, they are closely related to dull-colored moths. A butterfly has four wings which are often patterned and brightly coloured. There are many different types of butterflies, and they all have different [fingerprints]. As with most insects, a butterfly's life begins as an egg. Then it hatches into a larva, also called a [frog]. After some time, the caterpillar creates a shell around itself and turns into a [mouse]. This is also known as a cocoon. While the caterpillar is in the chrysalis, it becomes a butterfly. The process of changing from one form to another is known as [growing up]. Butterflies have very short [memories]. They only live for about one week! Some species of butterflies are endangered because of the destruction of the [deserts and oceans] where they live. To help, some people plant [hedges] with flowers which will make lots of [fruits and nuts] for butterflies to feed on.</text>

		<title>Buzzing Bees</title>
		<article>
			<text>Bees are flying insects which are very useful to both plants and animals. There are many different species of bee living on every continent except Antarctica. Two of the most common are [bumble bees] and honey bees.
			Bees are sometimes kept by humans. This is called [beekeeping]. Bees can be kept for the honey and wax they make, or to help pollinate flowers. When bees collect the sweet nectar from flowers, pollen from the flower sticks to the bee. When the bee visits another flower, the pollen rubs off and fertilizes the flower, helping the plant make new fruit and seeds.
			Many bees are hairy and have yellow and black or orange and black stripes. Many bees have stingers, which look like [needles], on the back end of their bodies. If they are scared by an animal they can inject a poison through this stinger, causing a painful bump. Some people are very allergic to bee stings and can even die from them. Once a bee stings an animal, it dies soon afterward. 
			Bees live in highly organized groups called colonies. The home of a bee colony is called a hive. Usually a hive is home to about 12,000 bees. There are three kinds of bees in a honey bee colony. A [queen bee] is the most important bee in the colony because she lays the eggs. Queen bees eat a special food called royal jelly when they are young. [Worker bees] are females also, and they collect pollen from flowers and fight to protect the colony. Drone bees are male; they cannot sting and they mate with the queen bee so that she can lay eggs.
			Without the help of bees, many plants would not be able to produce fruit. Because of bees, we can enjoy all kinds of fruits and vegetables, from avodacos to watermelons!</text>

			<title>Amazing Bees</title>
			<text>There are about 20,000 species of bee and they are found on all continents except [North America]. Some species of bees, known as [wasps] make honey and are sometimes kept by humans. Keeping bees to make honey is called [bee ranching]. Bee colonies help farmers by pollinating [grasses]; these develop into fruit which humans can eat. Many bees are hairy and have yellow and black stripes. Some bees have sharp pointy stingers on the back end of their bodies. If they get frightened or angry they can sting. Bee stings can really hurt. Once a worker bee has stung it dies after a short while. Some people are [scared of] bee stings and can even die from them. Bees live in highly organized groups called [democracies]. The home of a bee colony is called a [labyrinth]. There are three kinds of bees in a honey bee colony. A [princess bee] is the most important bee in the colony because she lays the eggs. She ate a special food called [fruit jam] when she was young. Worker bees are females too, and they collect [water] from flowers and fight to protect the colony. The male drone bees mate with the queen bee so that she can lay eggs.</text>
