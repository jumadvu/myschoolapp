			<title>What is a dinosaur?</title>
			<article>
				a group of prehistoric reptiles
				all dinosaurs are reptiles, hatch from eggs
				more than 1000 species discovered, more every year!
				meat eaters, plant eaters, small as a pigeon or three stories tall
				biggest land animals ever (blue whale is still the most massive animal ever)
				dinosaurs don't fly or swim! icthyosaurs and pterosaurs are prehistoric reptiles too, but not dinosaurs!
				dino-saur means terrible lizard, named by sir richard owen. he only knew about three kinds of dinosaur, each of which walked on land
				later, when swimming and flying reptiles were discovered, we called them winged-lizard and fish-lizard to tell them apart
				there are many kinds of saur! usually when people say 'dinosaur' they mean any large prehistoric reptile.
				no dinosaurs are alive today, but scientists agree that the birds we know today are their closest living relative.

				<title>Dinosaurs: The Terrible Lizards</title>
				<text>Dinosaurs were reptiles that lived [millions] of years ago. The word "dinosaur" comes from [Greek], meaning "terrible lizard". The name was coined by the English [biologist] Richard Owen in 1842. The first fossils of dinosaurs are from about 230 million years ago. About 65 million years ago, dinosaurs became [extinct]. Birds are the descendants of dinosaurs. There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Today scientists know about hundreds of different species of dinosaur. Some, called [herbivores], ate plants. Others, called carnivores, ate meat. The largest dinosaurs were plant-eaters, like [Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus]. They were the largest animals to ever walk on dry land. Other plant-eaters had special weapons, to help them fight off the meat-eaters. For example, Triceratops had [three horns] on its head shield, Ankylosaurus was covered in bony plates, and Stegosaurus had spikes on its tail. Scientists have a good idea of what they looked like, because of the [fossil bones] that have been found. Most meat-eaters were bipedal (walked on their back legs), though not as we are. Their body was more towards the horizontal, balanced at the back by their tail. Some dinosaurs were very large, like Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus, but some were small, like Compsognathus. It was the smaller sized meat-eaters that may have evolved into birds. One of the first birds was Archaeopteryx; most of its skeleton looked much like that of a dinosaur. There were large flying reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs called [pterosaurs]. There were also various kinds of large reptiles that could swim, like ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs.

			<title>Dinosaur origins</title>
			<article>
				dinosaur fossils have been found on every continent on earth. even Antarctica!
				how is this? many years ago, the continents were united in one big mass called Pangea. In the time of Pangea, the Earth was warmer, with many more active volcanoes. This huge continent was a warm place covered with trees and plants. 
				Before dinosaurs, there were no mammals, but there were many reptiles, amphibians, fish and crustaceans. 
				the closest ancestors of dinosaurs likely looked a lot like crocodiles. they ate meat, walked on four legs, and had long tails. 
				over time, these reptiles evolved to walk on two legs and become the very fist dinosaurs. these dinosaurs were small and fast, about the size of chickens. 
				over time, these tiny predators become very successful hunters and were able to move all over Pangea. over millions of years, dinosaurs adapted to many different environments and evolved into the shapes we know today. some stayed small, others became huge. some adapted to walk on four legs and eat plants.
