<text>[File:Martin Luther King 

Jr with medallion NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Martin Luther King, Jr.]

'Dr Martin Luther King, Junior' ([January 15], [1929] ΓÇô [April 4], 

[1968]) was a famous [American] who fought for [human rights]. He was born 

in [Atlanta], [Georgia], [USA]. He was 

the son of Martin Luther King Sr., who was also a civil rights leader. 



He became a [Baptist] minister. He worked hard to make people understand that 

black people should 'always' be treated equally to white people. He gave 

speeches and led rallies to encourage African Americans to protest without the 

need for violence. One peaceful strategy was for African Americans to have sit-

ins, where they would sit in a restaurant seat that was supposed to be only for 

white people, politely ask for some food, and refuse to leave until someone gave 

them food.



[King 

speaking at the [March on Washington]]

He first began to be well-known in 1955 when he led a [protest] against the 

way black people were segregated on buses. At that time they had to sit at the 

back of the bus, separate from white people. He soon became world famous when he 

told his supporters, and the people who were against equal rights, that only 

peaceful ways should be used to solve the problem. In 1964 black people finally 

were allowed to [vote] in [elections]. In this year he was given the [Nobel 

Peace Prize].



After this he continued to work with many others to fight against [poverty] 

and the [Vietnam War]. In 1986, the United States created a national 

[holiday], commonly known as 'Martin Luther King Day', in his honor. It is 

celebrated on the third Monday of the month of January; around the time of his 

birthday. The holiday was created because people had campaigned (called for) 

this to happen. One of these people was the singer [Stevie Wonder] who wrote a 

song as part of the campaign. King said to his mother he would turn this world 

upside down, and he followed through with that promise. On the evening of April 

4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, 

where he was preparing to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage 

workers of that city, he was assassinated.





Simple Facts:

He was born in Atlanta on January 15th 1929. ┬áWhen he was born, the physician 

in charge accidentally wrote his name down as 'Michael' on his birth 

certificate. King was active from the start of the┬áMontgomery Bus Boycott┬áof 

1955 to 1956 until his murder in April 1968.

┬áAfter graduating from college in 1948, he was not sure about which profession 

to join. He considered a career in medicine and law but rejected both and joined 

the Baptist Church. He studied at a Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania. It was 

while studying here that King learned about the non-violent methods used by 

Mahatma Gandhi against the British in India. King was convinced that such 

methods would be of great value to the civil rights movement. ┬á 

He was appointed the president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, which 

was created during the boycott, and he became a prominent leader of the boycott. 

King was arrested for starting a boycott and fined $500 with $500 costs. His 

house was fire-bombed and others involved with MIA were also intimidated - but 

by the end of 1956, segregation had been lifted in Montgomery and bus 

integration had been introduced.┬á 

Another result of the boycott was the establishment of the Southern Christian 

Leadership Conference (SCLC). This organization was committed to the use of non-

violence and its motto was 'Not one hair of one head of one person should 

be harmed.' Martin Luther King was elected its president. 

The march - officially the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom - was a 

major success. Held on August 28th, 1963. The final speaker was Martin Luther 

King and it was here that he made his legendary 'I have a Dream' speech which 

was heard throughout the world and did a huge amount to publicise the civil 

rights movement in America across the world.

In 1964,he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

King then moved on to a bill that would guarantee the voting rights of the black 

community in America. This led to the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

King had clearly made enemies in his rise to fame. At the most basic level, 

the┬áKlu Klux Klan┬ádid what they could to tarnish his name in the South. 

However, it was the work done by the FBI under the leadership of J Edgar Hoover 

that did most damage. ┬á 

On April 4th, 1968, Martin Luther King was shot dead by an assassin. His death 

sparked off riots in many cities and 46 people were killed during these. In 

March 1969, James Earl Ray was found guilty of King's murder and sentenced to 99 

years in prison.

		<title>Christopher Columbus</title>
		<article>
<text>'Christopher Columbus' was a trader and [explorer]. He was born in 

[Genoa], [Italy] by a wool weaver in [1451] and died [May 20], [1506] 

in [Valladolid]. While he did not actually discover the Americas, he 

discovered the Bahamas, however close to the americas. He was once called the 

first [Europe]an to find out because people already lived at the [The 

Americas|Americas], though it is known now that the [Vikings] did this 

earlier.



Columbus sailed the [Atlantic Ocean] because he was hoping to find a shorter, 

safer way to [China] and [India]. He wanted to bring back [spices] and 

gold for the King and Queen of [Spain]: [Isabella I of Castile] and 

[Ferdinand II of Aragon]. He knew that the world was round but he did not know 

how large it was. He had heard that [Marco Polo] had found a sea to the east 

of China and he believed that it must be the same as sea to the west of 

[Europe]. He did not really know about the [Pacific Ocean] and The Americas, 

and that the Atlantic Ocean did not go all the way to China. 



When he found some islands at the end of his voyage, he thought he had reached 

the [East Indies] when in fact he had landed on an island in the [Bahamas]. 

That is why he named the people living there 'Indians'. In all, he 

made four voyages to America. [Colombia] is also named after him.





Origins of Christopher Columbus

There is disagreement on where Columbus came from. Numerous people think that he 

was born in [Genoa]. Experts have studied clues to Columbus' birthplace, but 

no final answer has been found.



He was arrested in Santo Domingo August 23, 1500. Sent to Spain in chains in 

October 1500. Released December 12, 1500 and summoned to court. His passions 

were exploring and navigating. He piloted five voyages to the Bahamas believing 

he had reached the Indies.

'Marie Sk┼éodowskaΓÇôCurie' (7 November 1867 ΓÇô 4 July 1934) was a 

[physicist] and [chemist] from [Poland] but lived in [France]. She was 

an expert in the field of [radioactivity] and the only person to get the 

[Nobel Prize] intwo different sciences. She was the first woman professor at 

the [University of Paris].



She was born under the name 'Maria Sk┼éodowska' in [Warsaw], [Poland], 

and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister 

Bronis┼éawa to study in [Paris], where she received her higher degrees and did 

her important scientific work. She founded the [Curie Institutes] in Paris and 

Warsaw. Her husband [Pierre Curie] also won a Nobel Prize, so did her daughter 

[Ir├(r)ne Joliot-Curie] and son-in-law [Fr├(c)d├(c)ric Joliot-Curie].



Her achievements include the creation of a theory of '[radioactivity]' (a 

term coined by her and Pierre), techniques for separate radioactive 

[isotopes], and she discovered two new elements, [radium] and [polonium]. 

It was also under her own direction that the world's first studies were used 

into the treatment of cancers, using the radioactive isotopes. 



While being a French citizen, she never lost her Polish identity. She named the 

first new [chemical element] that she discovered (1898) 

'[polonium]' after her home country, [Poland], and in 1932 she 

founded a Radium Institute in her home town [Warsaw], run by her physician-

sister Bronis┼éawa.
